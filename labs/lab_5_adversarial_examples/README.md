# Lab 5: Adversarial Examples and Special Topics
This week kind of acts like "convolutions: week 2", but it's mostly a bunch of special topics.

Only a couple of things this week are "necessary" for understanding how to build models with TensorFlow, but:
 - The optimization topics will help you train every model you use faster
 - The Keras topics are essential for building more advanced models with Keras
 - Adversarial attacks are really cool, and carrying out a black-box attack is a nice example of how powerful the things we've already covered are (and a good way to understand what the optimizer's doing more deeply)

Concepts this week:
 - Advanced optimizers
 - Adversarial noise
 - Black-box adversarial attacks

TensorFlow features this week:
 - Conditional execution in TensorFlow
 - Optimizing things other than model parameters
 - Controlling gradient flow
 - Keras functional API
 - Custom Keras layers

Optional resources:
 - [The OpenAI blog](https://blog.openai.com/adversarial-example-research/) on how adversarial examples work and why they're hard to defend against
 - [This fantastic post on ruder.io](http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/) explaining a bunch of different SGD variants
 - [The Keras functional API guide](https://keras.io/getting-started/functional-api-guide/)
